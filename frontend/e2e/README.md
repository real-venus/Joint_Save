# E2E tests (Playwright)

End-to-end coverage for JointSave's critical user flows, built with
[Playwright](https://playwright.dev/).

## What's covered

| Spec | Flow |
|------|------|
| `create-pool.spec.ts` | Create each pool type (rotational / target / flexible) → redirect to the group page → read on-chain state back → pool appears in **My Groups** |
| `deposit-flow.spec.ts` | Open a pool, deposit, see the submitted/confirming state, the updated balance, and a Deposit row in the activity feed |
| `wallet-connection.spec.ts` | Connect wallet → truncated address renders → disconnect → back to the landing page |
| `navigation.spec.ts` | Landing → dashboard → group detail → back, asserting no console errors |
| `responsive.spec.ts` | Dashboard & group pages render with no horizontal overflow at 375 / 768 / 1440 px |

## How it works — mocked boundary + a test-gated seam

Automating a real wallet popup is impossible, and CI has neither a Stellar wallet
extension nor a Supabase project. Rather than stand up a live chain (which would be
slow and flaky and still couldn't sign), the suite mocks the **edges** and runs
everything else for real:

- **Wallet & RPC** — the app reads `NEXT_PUBLIC_E2E=true` and activates a small,
  test-only seam in [`components/web3-provider.tsx`](../components/web3-provider.tsx)
  (a stub signer that auto-connects) and
  [`hooks/useJointSaveContracts.ts`](../hooks/useJointSaveContracts.ts) (stubbed
  `deploy`/`submitTx`/view-calls). These branches are **dead code** in production
  builds (the flag is unset).
- **Database** — `page.route()` intercepts every `/api/pools` request in the
  browser and serves it from an in-memory store, so the real Next API route and
  Supabase never run.
- **On-chain state** — tests inject `window.__E2E_STATE__` (balances, members,
  paused, etc.) which the read seam returns, making every screen deterministic.

The result: the full UI/logic — forms, validation, optimistic updates, balance
math, routing, responsiveness — is exercised for real, while only the
un-automatable network/wallet edges are stubbed. Runs in well under a minute with
no secrets and no flakiness.

Fixtures live in [`fixtures/`](./fixtures): `wallet.ts` (seed connection +
chain state), `mock-pools.ts` (the `/api/pools` mock), `constants.ts` (shared
ids/addresses, kept in sync with the seam), and `test-base.ts` (extends `test`
with a console-error collector).

## Running locally

```bash
cd frontend
pnpm install
pnpm exec playwright install chromium   # one-time browser download
pnpm test:e2e                           # headless run
pnpm test:e2e:ui                        # interactive UI mode
pnpm test:e2e:report                    # open the last HTML report
```

Playwright starts the dev server itself (with the E2E env baked into
`playwright.config.ts`) — you don't need a server running first.

## Flaky-test policy

Tests are designed to be deterministic (mocked boundary, no real network). To
guard against occasional CI hiccups (cold compiles, hydration timing), the config
in [`playwright.config.ts`](../playwright.config.ts) sets `retries: 2` **in CI
only** (`retries: 0` locally, so flakes surface immediately during development).
Any genuinely flaky test should be fixed or documented here — never silently
`test.skip`-ped.

One known timing nuance is handled explicitly: the wallet kit is wired in a mount
effect, so `wallet-connection.spec.ts` retries the initial connect click via
`expect(...).toPass()` until the address appears, rather than relying on a fixed
wait.
